# Scripts
General, useful, short GNU/Linux bash and POSIX scripts to add to PATH.

# TODO
* cleanup/remove the luke scripts I don't use
* refactor graphics setting scripts (gfxtools/...)
* ~~rofi/buku integration scripts~~
* make API functions return a symbol when there is no network connection

# Details
If a directory starts with _luke_ it contains scripts originally written by [Luke Smith](https://lukesmith.xyz/) as part of his [archi3 rice](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice/tree/archi3), but which could have been modified by me. Over time most of the Luke scripts will be removed.

Required by [my rice](https://github.com/kpatel28/KAR).
